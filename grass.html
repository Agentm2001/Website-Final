      <h1>My Favorite Grass Type Pokèmon</h1>
      <p>Grass was my original favorite typing. Though they have fallen to third place, I still think they have generally solid designs</p>
      <div class="fav">
        <div id="rose">
            <h2>#1 Roserade</h2>
            <p>The OG favorite. I love Roserade. The bouquet hands and the flower head. It's a Pokèmon made for showing off. As far as combat goes, it isn't amazing. It's poison typing is more of a hinderance than anything. Giving it more weaknesses without offering any new strengths. But bring this Pokèmon to a any contest and it will shine with flair. </p>

          <div id="meow">
            <h2>#2 Meowscarada</h2>
            <p>Meowscarada has the exact same flair as Roserade, but it's much better in a fight. The dark typing is a phenominal typing. But it holds on to the flair that I so love about Roserade. The only reason it didn't make it to number one was because of bias on my part. It's a favorites list. There is bias abound. </p>

          <div id="lura">
            <h2>#3 Lurantis</h2>
            <p>My favorite Pokèmon design to date. Clearly inspired by the Orchid Mantis, the most beautiful mantis, it lives up to the design. It's not particularly strong, but it's deadly precise in it's attacks. </p>

          </div>
          <div id="viri">
            <h2>#4 Virizion</h2>
            <p>My favorite of the protector trio of Unova. Graceful, strong, and confident. These three aspects are plain as day just from it's portrait. It has the knightly confidence befitting it's staition. Feels like the front man for its trio. I love the smug in its expression.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="leaf">
            <h2>#5 Leafeon</h2>
            <p>And last and I suppose least is Leafeon. Back in my early days of Pokèmon, Leafeon was my favorite Pokèmon hands down. But as the series grew, more interesting looking mons popped up and Leafeon just stated looking basic. I still hold a lovely spot in my heart for it, but it isn't lovely enough to get it higher than 5th. </p>
