		<h1>My Favorite Ground Type Pokèmon</h1>
		<p>
			Ground is my favorite typing for a Pokèmon. It's strong and mixes well
			with other types for fantastic versitility.
		</p>
		<div class="fav">
			<div id="gliscor">
				<h2>#1 Gliscor</h2>
				<p>
					Gliscor is another recent climber. I never got to catch one until
					Legends: Arceus. But, once I did it was an eye opener! The
					Ground/Flying type combo is amazing! But even more than that, it looks
					cool! It's like a scorpion with vampire bat mixed in. That's dope!
				</p>

			<div id="garchomp">
				<h2>#2 Garchomp</h2>
				<p>
					This true beast used to be #1 on my Ground list, and for good reason!
					This is the ace Pokèmon of the greatest and strongest champion in this
					entire franchise. Powerful, fast, bulking. Truely terrifying in every
					regard. Having a Garchomp on your team puts anyone on the fast track
					of victory.

			</div>
			<div id="groudon">
				<h2>#3 Groudon</h2>
				<p>
					The continent shaper. The drought bringer. Ocean's bane. My second
					favorite legendary. The coloring is emaculate. It looks like it would
					be a champion level Digimon if Sandshrew was a Digimon. It looks
					powerful. It's gigantic. It is described as the bane of oceans even
					though it has a weakness to water. I love it.
				</p>

			</div>
			<div id="torterra">
				<h2>#4 Torterra</h2>
				<p>
					My first ever starter. Even though it's primarily a Grass type, I like
					it more as a ground type. It's a tortoise with a mini island on it's
					back and that's cool! It's bulky and tough. It has the bearing of a
					creature you couldn't even scratch. The Detective Pikachu movie
					brought this Pokèmon back to the forfront for me.
				</p>

			<div id="claydol">
				<h2>#5 Claydol</h2>
				<p>
					Claydol is an interesting Pokèmon. It has the look of a guardian.
					Something left in ruins or temples to watch for intruders. This
					Pokèmon doesn't have much raw physical power, but it's special attack
					is very potent and is always a great addition to a team.
