      <h1>My Favorite Pokèmon</h1>
      <p>I love Pokèmon with every fiber of my being. I'm always bound to have favorite Pokèmon that fall outside of my favorite types. My favorites list thus far have been all about aesthetics. The look of a Pokèmon determines how willing I am to use it above it's potency in battle. This list is no different, except that the Pokèmon here transcend the favorites of the other lists. When it comes to my true favorites list, my top prerequisite is cuteness. I love cute Pokèmon. The kind you'd take with you to the Pokèmon contest hall.</p>

            <h2>#1 Budew</h2>
            <p>The cutest Pokèmon I have ever laid my eyes on. Look at it's little face! It looks like it tries it's very best! I love Budew. Favorite part has to be it's little cry when it enters battle. It's not strong or fast. It has some decent status moves, but not great offensive. Little things just adorable and I love it.</p>

            <h2>#2 Sandshrew</h2>
            <p>Phenominal little dude. Curls into a ball and rolls around. Cute. What can I say? The Alolan form is also really cute, but just doesn't quite make it to the original. All in all a cutie.</p>

          <div id="lop">
            <h2>#3 Lopunny</h2>
            <p>First not cute Pokèmon on this list. Lopunny is more beautiful than cute. The pre-3d era sprite had a motherly vibe to it, but has changed to an older sisterly vibe in recent times. It evolves with friendship and naturaly learns return and frustration. These moves' power changes based on the bond it has with it's trainer. In the hands of this pokemon these moves are devastatingly powerful.</p>

          <div id="mis">
            <h2>#4 Misdreavus</h2>
            <p>A prankster and a scamp. A Pokèmon that loves to scare and trick. The innocent face is made to lull would-be victims into a false sense of security before BAM, a bucket of water falls on their head. Or they fall off a cliff. Whichever is more convienient. A solid Pokèmon all around. I like it. </p>

          </div>
          <div id="aron">
            <h2>#5 Aron</h2>
            <p>Number 5 on this final list. Number 5 overall. Just an adorable little guy. It's immensely heavy with a diet of iron. It's got big innocent blue eyes (red in the shiny form) and four stubby legs. Would be a great starter Pokèmon if Gamefreak ever chose to change that formula.</p>
