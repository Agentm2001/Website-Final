      <h1>My Favorite Ghost Type Pokèmon</h1>
      <p>Ghost type pokemon are made to be creepy. They are one of the stronger types out there with neat designs.</p>
      <div class="fav">
        <div id="mismagius">
            <h2>#1 Mismagius</h2>
            <p>Mismagius has always been an interesting choice as my number 1 ghost type. Even to me. I don't use it often, but, as far as ghost types go, it has my favorite design. The spectral witch hat and the ribbon like arms into the dress-like body is S-tier.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="ceruledge">
            <h2>#2 Ceruledge</h2>
            <p>In the wake of the Scarlet and Violet games that have come out, I knew even before I bought the games I wanted Ceruledge on my team. The black knight theme has always been dope! The blade arms and the pokedex entry were truely the coolest. The Fire/Ghost typing lends itself to be a speedy damage dealer. But it doesn't take hits all too well.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="chandelure">
            <h2>#3 Chandelure</h2>
            <p>Chandelure is a late addition to the list. It's design isn't supper spectacular to me, but it's ability in battle is amazing. It has a high damage output and can take a decent beating. The Ghost/Fire typing offers a versitile mix. A fast attacker, a slow hit sponge, whatever you need to pad your team.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="banette">
            <h2>#4 Mega Banette</h2>
            <p>Mega Banette is my favorite mega design and my main reason for wanting megas to return. Banette's normal form isn't grand. The spindly arms look awkward on the body and I just can't bring myself to use it. But this mega looks amazing. The dark coloring with the open zipper AND the malicious spirit coming through the zippers that is terrifying. </p>

          </div>
          <div id="haunter">
            <h2>#5 Haunter</h2>
            <p>I'll be honest. Not quite fan of Haunter. I wanted to keep the top five theme going, but I don't have many ghost types I would deem my favorites. The rest are cool, but don't stand out to me. Haunter is here because of the 3 OG ghost Pokèmon it looks the coolest. </p>
